**Making an AI, generate insights to help conservationists and scientists generate insights and co-work to conserve freshwater in coastal areas, using mangroves.**

This project aims to solve the freshwater crisis using AI (LLM), whereby scientists and researchers can generate inferences at times, where humans may fail to get that click. The model (DialoGPT) out here has been fine-tuned on a really small corpus, and therfore can rather be declared as a prototype, that needs to be trained on much more data to have a proper usage. However, the results even after being trained so less, is really interesting for such a small model.

The project is an example of the combination of the naturally available conservation resources (mangroves in our case) and the finest piece of human ingenuity, AI, which so far, has had really less implementations in conserving what the nature has in store for us!
